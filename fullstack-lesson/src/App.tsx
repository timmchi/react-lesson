// Step 1. Think about the required functionality and break it down into logical parts

// * input field where the search is made
// * list of countries, which shows different things based on the length of the countries
// * detailed country

// Step 2. Create files (components) which will house the parts you came up with in the first step

// * in this step, you can create a mock structure without implementing logic

// Step 3. Continue building based on what you've already created

// const API_LINK = "https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/restcountries/";
// const ALL_COUNTRIES = "/api/all";
